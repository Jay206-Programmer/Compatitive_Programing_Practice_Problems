# Contribution

If you want to help the cause, you are most welcome! :heart:

here are the steps you will need to follow to make a **successful** _pull request_.

### Steps to make a **Contribution**:
:heavy_check_mark: 1) Create an **[Issue](https://github.com/Jay206-Programmer/Technical_Interview_Practice_Problems/issues/new/choose)**, I will **review** it and **assign the task to you** if everything is alright.

:heavy_check_mark: 2) **Wait** till I assign you the task. It will take around **3-4 hours**. If I don't assign you **within 6 hours** then you can make the _pull request_.

:heavy_check_mark: 3) If you don't know how to make an open source _**pull request**_  Go through [this blog](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/), it will help you.

### Examples of Things you can help with:
1) You can add **more problems**. Add the problem in **appropriate** *company_name* folder. If you dont know in which company the problem was asked then add the problem in **Unknown** Folder. 

2) You can solve the already solved problem in **Different Languages**. For example you can solve a **problem** which I solved with **python** in **Java,C++** etc.

3) **Improve** a already solved program!(Time complexity, Space Complexity)

### Rules:
:heavy_check_mark: Your program **MUST** work.

:heavy_check_mark: Program should atleast contain a **problem statement**.

:x: DO NOT CHANGE ANY PROGRAM WHICH ARE ALREADY THERE.

Your efforts matter,

**Thank you!** :blush:
